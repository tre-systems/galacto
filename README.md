# Galacto

A GPU-accelerated **self-gravitating N-body** galaxy sandbox: 16,384 bodies by default (adjustable up to 10×) where every star pulls on every other. Switch between scenarios — a cold rotating disk that spontaneously grows **spiral arms**, or two galaxies that **merge** into one spinning remnant — and dial the disk's stability (Toomre Q), speed, gravity, and dark-matter halo. Written in **Rust**, compiled to **WebAssembly**, and rendered with **WebGPU** — it runs entirely in the browser.

**Live:** [galacto.org](https://galacto.org/) — needs a [WebGPU-capable browser](#browser-support).

## Features

- **GPU compute physics** — the all-pairs gravity for every body runs in a WebGPU compute shader (workgroup-tiled); the CPU never touches per-body state.
- **Self-gravity N-body** — every body attracts every other, so structure forms for real rather than being scripted.
- **Selectable scenarios** — a dropdown switches the initial conditions: a **spiral disk** that grows arms, plus six multi-galaxy setups — **merger**, **head-on collision**, **retrograde merger**, **minor merger** (a shredded satellite), a **three-galaxy group**, and a **grand-design (M51)** flyby whose companion tidally draws out a bridge and two-armed structure.
- **Adjustable body count** — a slider sets the number of bodies (16,384 by default, up to 10×), re-seeding the scenario at the new resolution. Per-body mass scales as 1/N, so more bodies refine the *same* galaxy rather than piling on mass. The top end is heavy — gravity is all-pairs O(N²), so high counts automatically cap simulation speed to keep the browser responsive.
- **Live physics knobs** — gravity strength, dark-matter halo strength and **size** (scale radius), and star size adjust the *running* simulation in real time (no restart); the galaxy collapses, disperses, or recolours as you drag, and the rotation curve reshapes with it. A **?** by every control explains what it does.
- **Galaxy-structure knobs** — beyond stability (Toomre Q), set how much of the disk is cold **gas** (the blue, star-forming arm component) and the **bulge** mass fraction (sweeping from disk-dominated late types to bulge-dominated early types). Both re-seed the galaxy.
- **Visualize the dark matter** — the otherwise-invisible halo can be toggled on as a soft violet glow centred on the galaxy, sized to the active profile's scale radius (broad for the logarithmic halo, tighter for NFW) so you can see the cloud the stars orbit within.
- **Live rotation curve** — an optional overlay plots the circular speed _v(r)_ in physical units (km/s vs kpc), decomposed into disk + bulge + dark-matter halo. The flat outer curve held up by the halo is the classic observational clue behind dark matter — drag the **Halo** or **Gravity** sliders and watch it respond. A clock shows the elapsed simulated time (the run is calibrated so one length unit ≈ 0.1 kpc and the default halo flattens at ~220 km/s).
- **Toomre Q (disk stability)** — the disk slider is the actual **Toomre stability parameter**: the radial velocity dispersion is set per-radius from Q (σ_R = Q·3.36GΣ/κ). Q≲1 fragments into clumps, Q≈1–2 swing-amplifies into spiral arms, Q≫2 stays a smooth smear — the textbook stability sequence, live. It's a seed-time property, so it's *staged* and applied on **Restart**.
- **Rust → WebAssembly** — the core compiles to WASM for near-native speed.
- **Generative soundscape** — a vast, layered cosmic-ambient space that starts on your first interaction (browsers block audio until then), entirely synthesized in the browser (Web Audio oscillators, a code-generated reverb and feedback delay, an octave-up shimmer — no sample files). A deep **drone pad** over a **sub-bass** foundation, a high **twinkling starfield**, and a shimmering reverb give it the scale of deep space. It's driven by the galaxy itself: a tiny GPU readback tracks how much **mass has gathered at the centre**, how fast it's **moving in or out**, and whether that motion is an **organized collapse or random churn**, so the pad swells, brightens, and focuses into tension as the core collapses and settles back as it disperses. Every control takes its own clear voice — **scenario** sets the scale and mood (serene for the lone disks, tense for the collisions), **zoom** moves you through the space (close = bright and dry, far = dark and cavernous), **orbiting** swings the whole soundscape across the stereo field, and the physics knobs each colour it (gravity leans the pitch, gas and glow open the air and shimmer, the halo deepens the space, the body count sets the starfield density). Everything is slew-limited, so the sound always glides — cinematic, never abrupt. It's tuned for **calm and a sense of scale**, following the relaxation research where it applies: a slow, sparse note grid (~50–85 BPM, never frantic), soft note onsets, consonant scales and no repeating melody, plus a gentle **~0.1 Hz swell** on the bed near the common voluntary HRV-breathing resonance. The article is explicit about what is evidence-backed and what is an aesthetic hypothesis.
- **Interactive 3D camera** — orbit, zoom, pause, and reset, with mouse, keyboard, and touch.
- **Adjustable speed** — an on-screen slider scales the simulation from slow-motion up to 8× so the structure develops in seconds, with the fixed timestep keeping the physics frame-rate-independent; very high body counts cap the effective speed for stability.
- **Collapsible controls** — the control panel folds away to a small ⚙ button so it stays out of the view.
- **Installable PWA** — a web manifest, maskable icons, and a service worker make it installable to the home screen and launchable offline; the precached app shell (glue, WASM, styles) also loads instantly on repeat visits, while navigation stays network-first so a new deploy shows immediately. When a new version is deployed, an in-app prompt offers a one-click reload, and an Open Graph card gives it a proper preview when shared.
- **Edge-deployed** — ships as a static site on Cloudflare Pages.

### Audio & video production

A finished piece is rendered **headlessly** — there's no in-app export UI. The composed audio is a deterministic cinematic A→B→C arc (sparse intro → gathering build → serene awe peak → dispersing resolution), keyed by a seed + length, synthesised and mastered **entirely in WebAssembly**: rendered **offline** (faster than real time, glitch-free), then auto-mastered — stereo-balance correction, a subsonic high-pass, the deep bass summed to mono for translation, **ITU-R BS.1770 loudness normalisation** to a target (−16 LUFS by default), and a **true-peak limiter to −1 dBTP** so it stays clean through lossy codecs — with a quality report (loudness, true peak, stereo correlation, tonal balance). No DAW needed.

For a finished, YouTube-ready video in **one command**:

```bash
npm run produce -- --seed 5 --duration 600
# → a 10-minute MP4 (HEVC + AAC) with the cinematic arrangement, mastered audio,
#   and start/end captions — visuals and sound rendered from the same seed, so locked.
```

It builds, captures the arrangement headlessly, renders the matching mastered audio offline, muxes, and adds captions — no UI needed. The default 10-minute length is the researched sweet spot for a composed ambient piece, rendered at 2× the interactive body count for a denser galaxy (per-particle size scales as `1/√count`, so the frame rate stays smooth at 4K). See [Video production](docs/VIDEO_PRODUCTION.md).

## Architecture

![System overview](docs/diagrams/system-overview.png)

One `requestAnimationFrame` callback updates the camera, then per fixed step runs three GPU **compute** passes — a half-drift, an all-pairs gravity pass that sums each body's acceleration at the midpoint, then a kick + half-drift that advances it (a leapfrog step) — and issues one instanced **billboard** draw that reads the same buffer. Body state lives only in GPU memory — there is no CPU readback. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full picture.

## Physics

The model is a full **N-body** system: every body has mass and attracts every other (all-pairs gravity, O(N²)). The same solver drives both scenarios — only the initial conditions differ.

- **All-pairs gravity** — each body's acceleration is the Plummer-softened sum of the pull of every other body.
- **Dynamical friction** — a Chandrasekhar drag against the dark-matter halo, scaled by each body's mass. It's negligible for the light disk stars but visibly decays the orbits of the heavy galaxy cores, so colliding galaxies lose orbital energy and **sink together into one remnant** instead of sailing past. It is one real mechanism that helps mergers finish instead of remaining long-lived flybys.
- **Dark-matter halo** — a static halo adds an inward pull, in one of two selectable profiles: a **logarithmic** halo (the default — an unbounded potential that keeps the system bound, with a flat outer rotation curve) or an **NFW** halo (the cold-dark-matter profile — a rotation curve that rises then falls, with a finite potential that lets fast debris escape). The spiral disk is seeded in equilibrium with whichever is active.
- **Symplectic leapfrog (drift–kick–drift)** — computed in three passes per step (half-drift, gravity at the midpoint, then kick + half-drift): `x += v·dt/2; v += a·dt; x += v·dt/2`. It is 2nd-order and conserves energy far better than plain Euler, so the cold disk and orbits hold their structure over many more rotations.
- **Spiral disk** — a compact central bulge plus an exponential disk on near-circular prograde orbits. The radial velocity dispersion is set per-radius from the **Toomre Q** slider (σ_R = Q·3.36GΣ/κ, with a softening/thickness correction for this finite, softened disk). Q≲1 fragments into clumps, Q≫2 stays a smooth smear, and **spiral arms** (swing-amplified density waves) live in between.
- **Gas + star formation** — about a quarter of the disk is a **dissipative gas** component: unlike the collisionless stars, it sheds its random (radial and vertical) motion each step (a sticky-gas stand-in for shock cooling), so it stays a thin cold layer that piles up in the spiral arms. It's drawn a bright blue — the cold, star-forming gas that traces the arms of real spirals and keeps them sharp as the stellar disk heats and blurs.
- **Galaxy merger** — two such disks, each anchored by a heavy core, on a bound prograde approach. Self-gravity and dynamical friction pull them together into one spinning remnant.

Initial conditions derive from a fixed RNG seed, so a given scenario and temperature start repeatably. Long-run paths are not promised bit-for-bit across GPUs. See [ARCHITECTURE § Simulation & Physics](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#simulation--physics) for the kernels, the exact formulas, and the tuning constants.
